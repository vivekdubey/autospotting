A simple and easy to use tool designed to significantly lower your Amazon AWS
costs by automating the use of [spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot) instances.

## How does it work?

When installed and enabled on an existing on-demand AutoScaling group,
AutoSpotting clones one of your on-demand instances from the group with a spot
instance that is cheaper, at least as large (automatically considering memory,
CPU cores and disk volumes) and configured identically to it. Once the new spot
instance is ready, it is attached to the group and an on-demand instance is
detached and terminated, to keep the group at constant capacity.

It continuously applies this process, across all enabled groups from all regions,
gradually replacing your on-demand instances with much cheaper spot instances.
For your peace of mind, you can also configure it to keep running a configurable
number of on-demand instances, given as percentage or absolute number.

Your groups will then monitor and use these spot instances just like they would
do with your on-demand instances. They will automatically join your load balancer
and start receiving traffic once passing the health checks.

The installation takes just a few minutes and the existing groups can be enabled
and configured individually by using a few additional tags.

Read [here](TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md) for more information and implementation
details.

Frequently asked questions about the project are answered in the [FAQ](FAQ.md),
*please read this first before asking for support*.

If you have additional questions not covered there, they can be easily added to
the [crowdsourced source of the FAQ](https://etherpad.net/p/AutoSpotting_FAQ)
and we'll do our best to answer them either there or on Gitter.

## Getting Started ##

Just like in the above animation, it's as easy as launching a CloudFormation (or
[Terraform](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/tree/master/terraform))
stack and setting the `spot-enabled` tag on the AutoScaling groups where
you want it enabled to `true`.

For more detailed information you can read this [document](START.md)

[![Launch](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=AutoSpotting&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudprowess/nightly/template.json)

Note: this installs the latest nightly build, generated automatically from the
 code after each commit. Even though it's generally stable, it is meant to be
 used for evaluation purposes and is **not recommended for production use**. It
 expires after two months from the date in which the binary was built and comes
 with no support or warranty.

Stable, carefully tested and supported builds are available from the original
author for a fee. Using these builds you are also helping the further
development of the software. Please get in touch on
[gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim) if you are interested in purchasing a stable
build.

## Compiling and Installing ##

Even though it's recommended to use the provided stable binaries, in case you
have some special needs, you can tweak the software, then build and run your
customized binaries which for example can be configured not to expire.

More details are available [here](CUSTOM_BUILDS.md)

## Contributing ##

This project was developed by volunteers in their own spare time. If you find it
useful please consider contributing to its development, any help would be
greatly appreciated.

You can do it by trying it out and giving feedback, reporting bugs, writing
code, improving the documentation, assigning someone to work on it for a few
hours a week, spreading the word or simply
[contacting](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting) us and telling about your
setup.

Non-trivial code should be submitted according to the contribution
[guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Support ##

Community support is available on the
[gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim/autospotting) chat room on a best effort
basis, and people may help you solve issues with the nightly/evaluation
binaries.

For the stable AutoSpotting builds, the main author also offers enterprise-grade
support and will do as much as possible to help you out with any issues you may
have. In addition, custom feature development as well as AWS-related
consulting are available for a fee. For more information feel free to get in
touch on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim).

## Users ##

Autospotting is already used by hundreds of individuals and companies around the
world, such as:

## Uninstall ##

You just need to remove the AutoSpotting CloudFormation or Terraform stack.

The groups will eventually revert to the original state once the spot market price
fluctuations terminate all the spot instances. In some cases this may take months,
so you can also terminate them sooner yourself.

Fine-grained control on a per group level can be achieved by removing or setting
the `spot-enabled` tag to any other value. AutoSpotting only touches groups where
this tag is set to `true`.
